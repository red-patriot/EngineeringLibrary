# EngineeringLibrary

A library designed to help engineers with quick calculations.

---

## Description

I originally created this library during my undergrad to perform hand calculations for homework. It can track units in both metric and imperial, though metric units are somewhat more accurate due to rounding errors in imperial. The library also has many userful functions for performing engineering analysis.

It is indended to be used by any engineer or engineering student as a productivity tool.

This library is entirely open source, so it can be forked and improved by anyone who so desires.
